## How to install in a new machine
Given that this is a new blankslate machine, some steps are required to make it into a fully operational dev workstation to my likings :P 

## Pre-requisites
  * Rake

### Ubuntu
TODO: Point directions to install each one of these dependencies 

 * Install git
 * Install curl (for rvm)
 * Install ruby 
 * Install vim 

#### Irssi
 * Create the service daemon for listening to notifications

#### Vim GIST 

You have to export in your .bashrc file both variables GITHUB\_USER and GITHUB\_TOKEN.
Since those are sensitive data, its not a good idea to share this information publicly 

### Mac OSX
 * Install homebrew
 * Install XCode 
 * Install Git (brew install git bash-completion) 
 * Install RVM

### Windows

Sorry i don't use windows for quite a long now, so i can't give any pointers. You're by yourself.
